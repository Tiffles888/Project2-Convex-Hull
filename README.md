# Project2-Convex-Hull
Made by Tiffany Lee individually, Period 4 APCS 
This code is able to sense the shortest distance possible to enclose the point set given.

The code is split into different classes that:
1. set up the points on the frame
2. measure the distance between two points
3. redraw line
